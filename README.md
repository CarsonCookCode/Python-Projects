# Basic Python Projects
This repository contains my projects from the python course during my time at The Tech Academy.

## Projects:
- [File Transfer](https://github.com/CarsonCookCode/Python-Projects/blob/main/fileTransfer3.py)
- [Student Database Interface](https://github.com/CarsonCookCode/Python-Projects/tree/main/trackingFolder)
- [Basic Django Set Up](https://github.com/CarsonCookCode/Python-Projects/tree/main/DjangoUniversity)
- [Django Banking](https://github.com/CarsonCookCode/Python-Projects/tree/main/myDjangoProject)

### File Transfer
This project uses python and allows the user to to transfer all text files from one folder to another if the file has been created or modified in the last 24 hours.

### Student Database Interface
This project uses python and provides the user an interface to create, update, and delete information about students in a database.

### Basic Django Set Up
This project gave me an opportunity to practice setting up a basic functioning Django program where you can connect to the server and to a database.

### Django Banking
This project uses Django to make a basic banking account system. You can create an account, make transactions (deposits, withdrawals) to a database, and view your current balance and transactions made.
